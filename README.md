NVS - Network Vulnerability Scanner
NVS (Network Vulnerability Scanner) is a lightweight Python tool designed to help identify basic vulnerabilities in networked systems. Whether you're scanning for open ports, checking HTTP headers for security misconfigurations, or resolving DNS information, NVS provides a simple and approachable way to gather key insights about your network.

# Features
Open Port Scanning: Quickly scans the first 1024 ports on a target domain or IP address.
HTTP Header Analysis: Identifies missing security headers like X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options.
DNS Resolution: Resolves domain names to their respective IP addresses using public DNS servers.

# Notes
NVS is not intended as a comprehensive vulnerability scanner but rather a basic tool for educational and diagnostic purposes.
Use responsibly and only on networks you own or have explicit permission to scan.
